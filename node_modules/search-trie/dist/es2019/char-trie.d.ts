 * builds a "char" based search trie.
 * Optimized for random inputs with unpredictable variation
 *
 * pros:
 * - more stable speed at large sets
 * - every character matters, you can get the longest prefix available even without value
 *
 * cons:
 * - more operations are required to perform a single search
 *
 * - input: array of {key:string, value}
